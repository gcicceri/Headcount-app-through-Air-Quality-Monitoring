# Abstract
In this work, we propose a low-cost Smart and Healthy Intelligent Room System (SHIRS), able to monitor Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) by enhancing edge-based computation. SHIRS exploits the ability to run Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to infer humans presence (headcount) from environmental data analysis. Experimental results show the validity of the proposed approach, demonstrate the potential of edge-based computing and push towards the adoption of smart integrated Cloud-IoT frameworks for environmental monitoring and control.


# Dataset
The dataset contains data on air quality monitoring and people counter of an office room at the University of Messina. Data is stored and labeled with the corresponding people number.

A single record is composed by;
Date s is a timestamp; 
Id is an Identifier number; 
Pm1, Pm 2.5 and Pm10 are the dust sensors;
Temp is the temperature;
Hum is humidity;
Press is the atmospheric pressure; 
CO and CO2 are the concentrations;
Label is the number of people. 

Dataset is available in a Zenodo repository -->  http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3742173
